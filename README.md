# Puppet Gearswap for Windower

Currently a work in progress.

#Auto Maneuvers:
//gs c automan
 
Currently, the way this works is it will simply recast the maneuver that wears off. This way you can cast any maneuvers you want and it will simply attempt to maintain what you have active.
 
#Predict:
//gs c predict
 
This will attempt to determine the currently equipped puppet and adjust the Pet Mode and Pet Style.
 
#Pet Mode:
//gs c mode tank pdt
 
This will change the mode of the pet and the style of the pet.
Current Modes: TANK, DD, Mage
Current Styles:
- Tank: Normal, PDT, MDT, RANGE
